Snake Game
This is a basic implementation of the classic Snake Game built using Python and the Pygame library.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
The snake will grow longer when it eats the food, which appears randomly on the screen.
The game ends if the snake hits the boundaries of the screen or if it collides with itself.
Requirements
To run the game, you need to install the Pygame library. If you don't have it installed, you can easily install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x). You can download Python from the official website: python.org.

How to Run the Game
Clone or download the repository.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory containing the SnakeGame.py file.
Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
python SnakeGame.py
Game Features
